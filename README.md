# Casio-Web-Calculator
This is a Web Based Scientific Calculator.<br>
The inspiration is taken from popular Casio electronic calculator.<br>
Actually, I wanted to replicate the complete function of this calculator (<a target="_blank" href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71tFoa7v5EL._SL1500_.jpg">see here </a> ) on web using javascript, but things got complecated and I took U turn and tried to build this one (<a target="_blank" href="https://mafstorage001.blob.core.windows.net/appimages/ProductImages/Standard/62574.jpg" >see here</a> ). 
Neverthless I tried to add more function to second calculator than It provided. 
<br>
At the end I ended up building this one: Visit:  <a href="http://abhishekraj007.github.io/apps/Casio-Web-Calculator/">Demo</a>
